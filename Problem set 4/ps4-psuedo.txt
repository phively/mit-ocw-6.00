Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

For each shift_int from 0 to 27, inclusive:
	Shift the letters in the string by shift_int
	For each substring, from the beginning of the current string to the next space:
		Check for valid words, where a valid word is all characters from the start of current_string to the next space, or the last character
		Trim the current tested word from the front of this substring
	Save the count of valid words for this shift_int
Return the integer shift_int producing the maximum count of valid words
